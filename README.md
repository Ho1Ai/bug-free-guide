# bug-free-guide
manuals for WaxusBS. Full name is "bug-free-guide" (or BFG), but it can be opened with "man" command (as in Linux, for example). I mean there will be nothing called "bfg" or "bug-free-guide" in WaxusBS ("man" will be used instead of this stuff), but this repository is for this "man". I thought there might be some people, who would like to develop something (e.g. text editor) and it will be a great idea to say how to add manuals for it

# what will I keep here
it will have a big manual for manuals-writting in readme.md file. Also this repo will keep manuals for default commands (e.g. "touch" or "useradd")
